I was thinking about using Arduino and mechanical pieces instead of a screen to make a real-life version of Pac-Man for my project. I don't think this is okay, though. This is still a relatively new notion, and nothing is set in stone yet.

I chose Pac-Man since it's a famous game that almost everyone recognizes. It appears like it might really happen that you could go through a maze and pick up dots. There are also obvious regulations, including not going near ghosts and trying to get everything. This makes it simple to turn into an actual game.

The most important point

The fundamental idea is to construct a true maze board that looks like a Pac-Man map. You wouldn't play on a screen; you'd play on a physical board. Pac-Man would be a small piece that moves through the maze, like a ball or something with a magnet.

We could make the maze out of wood, cardboard, or plastic, depending on what we have. An Arduino would have motors and connections that control movement under or within the board.

Regulations

The player can move Pac-Man with buttons or a joystick.

You can tell the Arduino to move Pac-Man in a given direction by hitting a button, but only if there isn't a wall in the way.

Going

In real life, Pac-Man would walk through the maze instead of on a computer. One option is to employ magnets, with Pac-Man on top and a magnet underneath that moves it. This concept came to me as we talked about how to move things with sand. Another way is to utilize tracks or rails that the item can slide on.

The Arduino would inform the motors what to do and keep Pac-Man from hitting barriers.

Dots and Points

For the dots, I could put in miniature buttons, beads, or sensors. When Pac-Man steps on one, it is "picked up." The Arduino can keep track of how many you have and show it with lights or sounds.

Power pellets may be bigger pieces that do something special, like make the ghosts move more slowly.

Spirits

The ghosts would also be genuine things that move around in the maze. They might move about randomly, follow set paths, or try to catch Pac-Man in a simple way.

Every ghost might have its own engine. If a ghost touched Pac-Man and a sensor picked it up, he would lose a life.

Winning and Losing

You win if you get all the dots.
You lose if a ghost catches you too many times.

The game would use:- LEDs that last a long time

- A buzzer for sound effects

- A score display with numbers might work.

Things that work mechanically

There would be a lot of mechanical parts in this project, like motors, gears, rails, magnets, pulleys, moving platforms, and so on. If the maze is modular, I could even be able to change it later.

How It Would Work:

1. You press a button.

2. It reads it with Arduino.

3. The engine makes Pac-Man move.

4. The sensor checks for dots or ghosts.

5. Get an update on your scores or lives.

6. Lights and noises react.

7. The game is still going on.

Issues

1. Things that could be hard:

2. Making sure everything goes together the right way

3. Stopping parts from getting stuck

4. Making the motion flow smoothly

5. Looking after all the wires

6. Making it stronger so it won't shatter

Thinking about it

This idea is great since it lets you code, build, and be creative all at the same time. It makes me think about how games work in the actual world, not just on a screen, like P5.js. I think it would be really fun and interesting to make a real-life Pac-Man game, even though this is only a rough idea for now.

The diary entry is only for ideas, and my final project might be different, but here is where I'm starting.
